# Advanced Real-Time Traffic Monitoring and Adaptive Signal Control System

## Project Overview
Traffic congestion in urban areas is a growing concern due to the increasing number of vehicles and the inefficiency of conventional fixed-timer traffic signals.  
This project proposes a **smart traffic control system** using **YOLOv8**, which detects, counts, and dynamically manages traffic signals in real-time based on lane-wise traffic density.  

The adaptive approach improves traffic flow, reduces waiting times at intersections, lowers fuel consumption, and enhances overall road efficiency. By leveraging **computer vision** and **artificial intelligence**, this solution provides a scalable and flexible system for smarter urban traffic management.
